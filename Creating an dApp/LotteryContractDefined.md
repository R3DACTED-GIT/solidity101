ABIEncoderV2 allows functions to accept and return arbitrarily nested arrays, structs, and other complex data types in the function parameters and return values. By using pragma abicoder v2, you enable this experimental feature and can take advantage of its benefits when defining functions that deal with complex data types.



# Imports
```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
import "./interfaces/IRandomNumberGenerator.sol";
import "./interfaces/IPancakeSwapLottery.sol";
```
### import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
This import statement brings in the "Ownable" contract from the OpenZeppelin library. The Ownable contract is commonly used to manage access control in smart contracts, allowing a single address (usually the contract deployer) to have special privileges and ownership over the contract.

### import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
This import statement brings in the "ReentrancyGuard" contract from the OpenZeppelin library. The ReentrancyGuard contract is used to protect against reentrancy attacks, where malicious attackers can exploit a contract's functions to reenter the contract and execute unintended code multiple times.

### import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
This import statement brings in the "IERC20" interface from the OpenZeppelin library. IERC20 is the standard interface for ERC20 tokens, defining the set of functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC20 compliant. This interface allows contracts to interact with ERC20 tokens in a standardized way.

### import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
This import statement brings in the "SafeERC20" library from the OpenZeppelin library. The SafeERC20 library provides additional safety checks when interacting with ERC20 tokens, helping to prevent common vulnerabilities like reentrancy and other potential issues.

### import "./interfaces/IRandomNumberGenerator.sol";
This import statement brings in a custom interface called "IRandomNumberGenerator." It likely defines functions that allow the contract to interact with an external random number generator service to obtain random numbers securely for use within the contract.

### import "./interfaces/IPancakeSwapLottery.sol";
This import statement brings in another custom interface called "IPancakeSwapLottery." It probably defines functions specific to a lottery contract that may interact with the PancakeSwap decentralized exchange or utilize specific PancakeSwap-related functionality.


# This code snippet is the beginning of "PancakeSwapLottery." It is implementing multiple contracts as well as defining several state variables. 
```
contract PancakeSwapLottery is ReentrancyGuard, IPancakeSwapLottery, Ownable {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    address public injectorAddress;
    address public operatorAddress;
    address public treasuryAddress;

    uint256 public currentLotteryId;
    uint256 public currentTicketId;
```
### PancakeSwapLottery is
- ReentrancyGuard: This contract is inherited to protect against reentrancy attacks, which occur when a malicious contract tries to exploit a vulnerable contract's reentrant functions.
- IPancakeSwapLottery: This is likely an interface contract that defines the functions that need to be implemented for the PancakeSwap lottery.
- Ownable: This contract provides a basic access control mechanism, allowing only the owner (usually the deployer) to execute specific functions.

### Using Statement:
- using SafeERC20 for IERC20;: This statement allows the contract to use the SafeERC20 library functions with the IERC20 interface. SafeERC20 provides additional safety checks when interacting with ERC20 tokens, minimizing potential risks.

### State Variables:
- address public injectorAddress;: This variable holds the address of the injector, likely an external entity that injects liquidity or performs specific actions in the lottery contract.

- address public operatorAddress;: This variable holds the address of the operator, who might have specific permissions and roles within the lottery contract.

- address public treasuryAddress;: This variable holds the address of the treasury, where certain portions of the lottery proceeds may be sent to.

- uint256 public currentLotteryId;: This variable holds the ID of the current lottery. It may be used to keep track of different lottery rounds or periods.

- uint256 public currentTicketId;: This variable holds the ID of the current ticket. It may be used to keep track of the ticket ID being issued to participants.


```
   uint256 public maxNumberTicketsPerBuyOrClaim = 100;

    uint256 public maxPriceTicketInCake = 50 ether;
    uint256 public minPriceTicketInCake = 0.005 ether;

    uint256 public pendingInjectionNextLottery;

    uint256 public constant MIN_DISCOUNT_DIVISOR = 300;
    uint256 public constant MIN_LENGTH_LOTTERY = 4 hours - 5 minutes; // 4 hours
    uint256 public constant MAX_LENGTH_LOTTERY = 4 days + 5 minutes; // 4 days
    uint256 public constant MAX_TREASURY_FEE = 3000; // 30%
```

- uint256 public maxNumberTicketsPerBuyOrClaim = 100;: This variable sets the maximum number of tickets that a participant can buy or claim in a single transaction. It's limited to 100 tickets per transaction.
  
- uint256 public maxPriceTicketInCake = 50 ether;: This variable sets the maximum price that a ticket can be purchased for in Cake tokens. It's set to 50 Cake tokens.

- uint256 public minPriceTicketInCake = 0.005 ether;: This variable sets the minimum price that a ticket can be purchased for in Cake tokens (or BNB). It's set to 0.005 Cake tokens.

- uint256 public pendingInjectionNextLottery; This variable keeps track of the pending Cake token injection for the next lottery round. It might be used to store the amount of Cake tokens that need to be added to the lottery pool before the next round starts.

- uint256 public constant MIN_DISCOUNT_DIVISOR = 300;: This is a constant variable that sets the minimum discount divisor. It's likely used to calculate the discount percentage in certain lottery-related calculations.

- uint256 public constant MIN_LENGTH_LOTTERY = 4 hours - 5 minutes;: This constant sets the minimum duration for a lottery round. It's set to 4 hours minus 5 minutes (3 hours and 55 minutes).

- uint256 public constant MAX_LENGTH_LOTTERY = 4 days + 5 minutes;: This constant sets the maximum duration for a lottery round. It's set to 4 days plus 5 minutes.

- uint256 public constant MAX_TREASURY_FEE = 3000;: This constant sets the maximum treasury fee percentage that can be applied to the lottery. It's set to 30%, represented as 3000 (since 100% = 10000).

# 
This part of the PancakeSwapLottery contract contains several important components, including state variables, enums, structs, modifiers, events, and the constructor. Let's break down each part:

### State Variables:
- IERC20 public cakeToken;: This variable represents the Cake token contract address, which is an ERC20 token.

- IRandomNumberGenerator public randomGenerator;: This variable represents the RandomNumberGenerator contract address, which is likely used to work with ChainLink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for obtaining random numbers securely.

### Enum:
- enum Status { Pending, Open, Close, Claimable }: This is an enumeration that defines different statuses for a lottery. The possible statuses are "Pending" (before the lottery starts), "Open" (while the lottery is active), "Close" (after the lottery ends but before the numbers are drawn), and "Claimable" (after the numbers are drawn, and prizes can be claimed).

### Structs:
- struct Lottery { ... }: This struct defines various properties and details of a lottery round, such as status, start time, end time, ticket price, rewards breakdown, treasury fee, and more.

- struct Ticket { ... }: This struct represents a lottery ticket, holding the chosen number and the address of the ticket owner.

### Mappings:
- Several mappings are used to keep track of lottery-related information, such as lottery data, ticket data, user ticket ids, and the number of tickets per unique combination for each lottery.

### Modifiers:
- modifier notContract(): This modifier ensures that the function caller is not a contract (proxy contract or a smart contract) to prevent potential exploits.

- modifier onlyOperator(): This modifier restricts access to functions only to the operator address specified in the contract.

- modifier onlyOwnerOrInjector(): This modifier allows access to specific functions for either the contract owner or the injector address.

### Events:
Several events are defined to emit important information to the frontend or other smart contracts when specific actions occur, such as lottery opening, ticket purchase, and prize claims.

### Constructor:
The constructor is executed when the contract is deployed. It takes two parameters, _cakeTokenAddress and _randomGeneratorAddress, which are used to set the addresses for the Cake token and the RandomNumberGenerator contract, respectively. It also initializes the _bracketCalculator mapping with predefined values for the lottery brackets.
This portion of the contract lays the groundwork for the lottery functionality by setting up various data structures, configurations, and interactions with external contracts for generating random numbers. Additional functions and logic will likely be implemented later in the contract to manage the lottery process, ticket purchasing, and prize distributions.

#
## This part of the PancakeSwapLottery contract contains the main functions that facilitate ticket purchasing, claiming prizes, lottery management, and other utility functions. Let's go through the important functions one by one:

### buyTickets: 
Allows users to buy tickets for the lottery. Users specify the lottery ID and an array of ticket numbers they want to purchase. The contract checks if the lottery is open, the ticket purchase limit is not exceeded, and the ticket numbers are within the valid range. The corresponding CAKE tokens are transferred from the user to the contract, and ticket-related information is updated.

### claimTickets: 
Allows users to claim prizes for their winning tickets after the lottery is drawn and in the claimable state. Users provide an array of ticket IDs and the corresponding brackets for each ticket. The contract verifies the validity of the claims and transfers the reward amount to the user.

### closeLottery: 
Called by the operator to close the lottery once the lottery end time has passed. It sets the lottery status to "Close" and prepares for the drawing of the final number.

### drawFinalNumberAndMakeLotteryClaimable: 
Called by the operator after the lottery is closed and the random number is generated by the RandomNumberGenerator contract. The final number is calculated, and rewards for each bracket are determined. The lottery status is set to "Claimable," and the lottery's CAKE prize distribution is finalized.

### changeRandomGenerator: 
Allows the contract owner to change the RandomNumberGenerator contract address.

### injectFunds: 
Allows the owner or injector to inject additional funds (CAKE tokens) into an open lottery.

### startLottery: 
Called by the operator to start a new lottery round with specific parameters, such as the end time, ticket price, reward breakdown, and treasury fee.

### recoverWrongTokens: 
Allows the contract owner to recover any tokens mistakenly sent to the contract (excluding CAKE tokens).

### setMinAndMaxTicketPriceInCake: 
Allows the contract owner to set the minimum and maximum ticket price in CAKE.

### setMaxNumberTicketsPerBuy: 
Allows the contract owner to set the maximum number of tickets a user can buy in a single transaction.

### setOperatorAndTreasuryAndInjectorAddresses: 
Allows the contract owner to set the operator, treasury, and injector addresses.

### calculateTotalPriceForBulkTickets: 
A utility function to calculate the total price for a set of tickets based on the discount divisor and ticket price.

### Various view functions: 
These functions provide read-only access to various lottery-related data, user ticket information, and rewards calculations.

### _calculateRewardsForTicketId and _calculateTotalPriceForBulkTickets: 
Internal utility functions used in the contract to calculate rewards for a specific ticket and the total price for bulk ticket purchases, respectively.

### _isContract: 
Internal utility function to check if an address is a contract.

## Overall, these functions form the core functionality of the lottery contract, enabling users to participate, claim rewards, and manage the lottery rounds. The contract aims to ensure fairness and security in the lottery process, leveraging the ChainLink VRF for generating random numbers.
