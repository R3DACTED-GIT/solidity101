# Interface Example
In this we will create an IERC20 token interface that includes functionality for allowance, totalSupply, transfer, approve, transferFrom, balance, mint, and burn functions.

```
pragma 0.8.0

// IERC20 Token Interface
interface IERC20 {
    // Get the token balance of a specific account
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);

    // Transfer tokens to a specified recipient
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

    // Approve the spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the owner
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

    // Transfer tokens from one address to another using a spender's allowance
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

    // Get the total supply of tokens
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    // Get the amount of tokens the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);

    // Mint new tokens and add them to the total supply
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

    // Burn a certain amount of tokens from an account
    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}
```
### Explanation:

- balanceOf: This function returns the token balance of a specific account (address).

- transfer: This function is used to transfer tokens to a specified recipient.

- approve: This function allows the token owner (current caller) to approve another address (spender) to spend a certain number of tokens on their behalf.

- transferFrom: This function allows a designated spender (with a previous approval) to transfer tokens from the sender's address to the specified recipient address.

- totalSupply: This function returns the total supply of tokens in circulation.

- allowance: This function checks the amount of tokens that the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.

- mint: This function is used to mint new tokens and add them to the total supply. Minting means creating new tokens.

- burn: This function is used to burn a certain amount of tokens from an account. Burning means permanently removing tokens from circulation.

## Task Guidelines:

1. Create a new Solidity file and define the IERC20 interface as shown above.
2. Implement all the functions in the interface in your ERC20 token contract (not part of this task).
3. Test the ERC20 token contract to ensure that all functions work correctly.
4. Remember that this is just the interface declaration. To fully implement the ERC20 token functionality, you need to write the corresponding code for the functions in your ERC20 token contract. Additionally, consider using events to signal token transfers and approval changes for better visibility and tracking. After implementing the contract, you can deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain or a local development network for testing and use in decentralized applications.
