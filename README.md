# solidity101
1. Prerequisites
	Basic understanding of blockchain concepts and Ethereum.
	Familiarity with programming concepts (e.g., variables, functions, loops).
2. Introduction to Solidity
	What is Solidity?
	Solidity's role in Ethereum smart contracts.
	Setting up the development environment (Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat).
3. Pragma and Imports
	Understanding the "pragma" statement and its purpose.
	Importing other Solidity files and using libraries.
4. Interface Declaration
	Introduction to interfaces and their significance.
	Creating an interface for ERC20 tokens.
5. Contract Declaration
	Defining a Solidity contract and its structure.
	Contract constructor and fallback functions.
6. State Variables
	Exploring state variables and their usage.
	Commonly used state variables in ERC20 tokens (e.g., "mapping", "balances").
7. Constructor Function
	Creating a constructor for contract initialization.
	Initializing state variables during deployment.
8. ERC20 Functions
	Implementing ERC20 standard functions:
	balanceOf
	transfer
	transferFrom
	approve
	allowance
	Understanding function modifiers like view and pure.
9. Events
	Using events to emit information from the contract.
	Subscribing to events from the front-end.
10. Internal Functions
	Differentiating between internal and external functions.
	Implementing internal helper functions for ERC20 operations.
11. Modifiers
	Understanding the role of modifiers in Solidity.
	Creating custom modifiers for access control.
12. Additional ERC20 Features
	Implementing other optional ERC20 functions like:
	totalSupply
	decimals
	Adding custom functionality to the ERC20 contract.
13. Security Best Practices
	Common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflow).
	Utilizing OpenZeppelin's Solidity library for secure contracts.
14. Deployment and Interactions
	Deploying the ERC20 contract on a test network (e.g., Rinkeby).
	Interacting with the contract using Remix or a custom front-end.
15. Project: Building a DApp with ERC20
	Applying the knowledge gained to build a decentralized application (DApp) that uses ERC20 tokens.
16. Advanced Topics (Optional)
	Inheritance and contract structuring.
	Upgrading contracts using proxy patterns.
	ERC20 token extensions (e.g., ERC721, ERC1155).
17. Conclusion
	Recap of the course.
	Guidance on further learning and exploration in Solidity.
