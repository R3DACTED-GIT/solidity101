# solidity101
## How to use
Each Section is in order of the layout of an ERC20 token. By following this, you should achieve the knowledge to create an ERC20 token.

## Prerequisites;
	- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts and Ethereum.
	- Familiarity with programming concepts (e.g., variables, functions, loops).
 ## Introduction to Solidity
	- What is Solidity?
	- Solidity's role in Ethereum smart contracts.
	- Setting up the development environment (Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat).
## Pragma and Imports
	- Understanding the "pragma" statement and its purpose.
	- Importing other Solidity files and using libraries.
## Interface Declaration
	- Introduction to interfaces and their significance.
	- Creating an interface for ERC20 tokens.
## Contract Declaration
	- Defining a Solidity contract and its structure.
	- Contract constructor and fallback functions.
## State Variables
	- Exploring state variables and their usage.
	- Commonly used state variables in ERC20 tokens (e.g., "mapping", "balances").
## Constructor Function
	- Creating a constructor for contract initialization.
	- Initializing state variables during deployment.
## ERC20 Functions
	- Implementing ERC20 standard functions:
	- balanceOf
	- transfer
	- transferFrom
	- approve
	- allowance
	- Understanding function modifiers like view and pure.
  	- Adding Taxes
## Events
	- Using events to emit information from the contract.
	- Subscribing to events from the front-end.
## Internal Functions
	- Differentiating between internal and external functions.
	- Implementing internal helper functions for ERC20 operations.
## Modifiers
	- Understanding the role of modifiers in Solidity.
	- Creating custom modifiers for access control.
## Additional ERC20 Features
	- Implementing other optional ERC20 functions like:
	- totalSupply
	- decimals
	- Adding custom functionality to the ERC20 contract.
## Security Best Practices
	- Common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflow).
	- Utilizing OpenZeppelin's Solidity library for secure contracts.
## Deployment and Interactions
	- Deploying the ERC20 contract on a test network (e.g., Rinkeby).
	- Interacting with the contract using Remix or a custom front-end.
## Project: Building a DApp with ERC20
	- Applying the knowledge gained to build a decentralized application (DApp) that uses ERC20 tokens.
## Advanced Topics (Optional)
	- Inheritance and contract structuring.
	- Upgrading contracts using proxy patterns.
	- ERC20 token extensions (e.g., ERC721, ERC1155).
## Conclusion
	- Recap of the course.
	- Guidance on further learning and exploration in Solidity.
