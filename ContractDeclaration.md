# Contract Declaration
In the context of Solidity, contract declaration refers to the process of defining a contract and its structure. A contract is a fundamental building block of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It encapsulates the code and data that define the rules and functionality of a decentralized application (DApp).

# A contract declaration in Solidity typically includes several essential components:

## Contract Name: The name of the contract, which serves as its identifier.
```
// Example 1: Simple contract name declaration
contract SimpleContract {
    // Contract code...
}
```
>Camel case is when a compound word or phrase has no spaces or punctuation. Instead, each separate word is indicated with either a lowercase or uppercase letter. Several companies use camel case in their names or for their products and systems. A few examples are: iPhone, FedEx, 
```
// Example 2: Contract name with CamelCase convention
contract myTokenContract {
    // Contract code...
}
```
