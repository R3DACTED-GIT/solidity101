# ERC20 Functions
ERC20 functions form the backbone of ERC20 token contracts, enabling the essential functionalities of transferring tokens, querying balances, approving spenders, and managing allowances. Understanding these functions, along with modifiers like view and pure, allows developers to create feature-rich and efficient ERC20 tokens that can cater to various use cases, including the implementation of custom features like taxes, mint, burn.

Note: The examples provided above are simplified for illustration purposes and may not include all necessary checks and considerations required for production-ready token contracts. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to implement proper access controls, security measures, and additional checks to ensure the contract's functionality and user safety. Additionally, the contract owner should be diligent in managing the minting and burning of tokens to prevent abuse and maintain transparency.

## balanceOf:

Definition: The balanceOf function is used to get the token balance of a specific address.

Explanation: This function allows anyone to query the token balance associated with a particular Ethereum address. It does not modify the contract's state and is considered a read-only function.

### Example:
```
solidity

contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[account];
    }
}
```
## transfer:

Definition: The transfer function is used to send tokens from the sender's address to a specified recipient.

Explanation: This function transfers a given amount of tokens from the sender's balance to the recipient's address. It updates the balances of both the sender and the recipient.

### Example:
```
solidity

contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[recipient] += amount;
    }
}
```
## transferFrom:

Definition: The transferFrom function is used to send tokens on behalf of a token holder (subject to approval).

Explanation: This function allows a designated spender to transfer tokens from the token holder's account to another recipient. The spender must have been approved previously by the token holder using the approve function.

### Example:
```
solidity

contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowances;

    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        require(allowances[sender][msg.sender] >= amount, "Not allowed to transfer");

        balances[sender] -= amount;
        balances[recipient] += amount;
        allowances[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```
## approve:

Definition: The approve function is used to give permission to a spender to transfer tokens from the sender's account.

Explanation: This function approves a specified spender (designated by the spender's address) to withdraw tokens from the sender's account, up to the approved amount. It is typically used in conjunction with the transferFrom function.

### Example:
```
solidity

contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowances;

    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external {
        allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
    }
}
```
## allowance:

Definition: The allowance function is used to query the amount of tokens that a spender is allowed to transfer from a specific token holder's account.

Explanation: This function returns the number of tokens that the spender is approved to transfer from the token holder's account.

### Example:
```
solidity
contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowances;

    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256) {
        return allowances[owner][spender];
    }
}
```
## Understanding Function Modifiers (view and pure):

- view: The view modifier is used for functions that do not modify the contract's state. They are read-only functions that provide access to data stored in the contract.

- pure: The pure modifier is used for functions that do not read from or modify the contract's state. They are used for computational tasks and do not interact with blockchain data.

### Example of Functions with Modifiers:
```
solidity

contract MathOperations {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) external pure returns (uint256) {
        return a + b;
    }

    function getSquare(uint256 a) external view returns (uint256) {
        return a * a;
    }
}
```
In this example, the add function is marked as pure because it performs a mathematical operation (a + b) without accessing or modifying the contract's state. The getSquare function is marked as view because it reads data (a * a) from the contract but does not modify it.

## Adding Taxes:

Adding taxes is not a specific ERC20 standard function but rather an additional feature that can be implemented in ERC20 token contracts. For instance, a tax could be applied to every transfer of tokens, deducting a small percentage of tokens as a fee. The deducted tokens could be directed to a designated address, such as a community fund or a charity wallet.

### Example:
```
solidity
contract TaxedToken is ERC20 {
    address public taxReceiver;
    uint256 public taxPercentage;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint256 _totalSupply, address _taxReceiver, uint256 _taxPercentage) ERC20(_name, _symbol, _totalSupply) {
        taxReceiver = _taxReceiver;
        taxPercentage = _taxPercentage;
    }

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external override returns (bool) {
        uint256 taxAmount = (amount * taxPercentage) / 100;
        uint256 netAmount = amount - taxAmount;

        _transfer(msg.sender, taxReceiver, taxAmount); // Send tax to the taxReceiver
        _transfer(msg.sender, recipient, netAmount); // Send the remaining amount to the recipient

        return true;
    }
}
```
In this example, we have a custom TaxedToken contract that extends the standard ERC20 token contract (ERC20). The constructor accepts additional parameters for taxReceiver (address to receive the tax) and taxPercentage (percentage of tax to apply). When the transfer function is called, it calculates the tax amount based on the specified percentage and deducts it from the transferred amount before completing the transfer.

## mint:

Definition: The mint function is used to create new tokens and add them to the total supply of the token contract.

Explanation: Minting refers to the process of generating new tokens and increasing the total supply of the token. This function is typically used by the contract owner or a designated authority to create additional tokens as needed.

### Example:

```
solidity

contract MyToken {
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    address public owner;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint256 _initialSupply) {
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;
        totalSupply = _initialSupply;
        balances[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    function mint(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        totalSupply += amount;
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
}
```
In this example, we have added a mint function that can be called only by the contract owner (onlyOwner modifier). The function increases the total supply of the token and credits the additional tokens to the owner's address.

## burn:

Definition: The burn function is used to destroy (burn) a specified number of tokens, reducing the total supply of the token contract.

Explanation: Burning tokens is a way to remove tokens from circulation permanently. This function is typically used when tokens are sent to a burn address or when users want to reduce their token holdings.

### Example:

```
solidity

contract MyToken {
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    address public owner;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint256 _initialSupply) {
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;
        totalSupply = _initialSupply;
        balances[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        totalSupply -= amount;
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```

In this example, we have added a burn function that allows token holders to burn a specified amount of their own tokens. The function reduces the total supply of the token and decreases the token holder's balance accordingly.
