# Internal Functions in Solidity

### Differentiating between Internal and External Functions:

In Solidity, functions can be classified as either internal or external based on their accessibility and how they can be invoked.

## Internal Functions:
Definition: Internal functions are functions that can only be called from within the same contract or from contracts that inherit from it.

Explanation: Internal functions are used to encapsulate logic that is meant to be used internally within the contract. They cannot be accessed directly from outside the contract, including from external accounts or contracts. However, derived contracts can call internal functions of their parent contract.

```
solidity

contract MyContract {
    // Internal function
    function internalFunction() internal {
        // Function logic
    }
}
```

## External Functions:
Definition: External functions are functions that can be called from outside the contract, typically by external accounts or other contracts.

Explanation: External functions are the default visibility in Solidity for functions declared in a contract. They can be accessed and called from external accounts or contracts but cannot be invoked by other functions within the same contract, unlike internal functions.
```
solidity

contract MyContract {
    // External function
    function externalFunction() external {
        // Function logic
    }
}
```

## Implementing Internal Helper Functions for ERC20 Operations:
Internal functions are commonly used as helper functions within a contract, especially in ERC20 token contracts, to encapsulate reusable logic and streamline ERC20 operations.

### Example: Internal Helper Function for SafeMath

```
solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ERC20Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) internal balances;

    function _add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        require(c >= a, "SafeMath: addition overflow");
        return c;
    }

    // Internal transfer function using the safe add helper function
    function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(sender != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(recipient != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

        // Check for sufficient balance
        require(amount <= balances[sender], "ERC20: insufficient balance");

        // Safe subtraction to deduct from sender
        balances[sender] = _add(balances[sender], amount);
        balances[recipient] += amount;

        // Emit transfer event
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    }

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
}
```
In this example, we have an ERC20Token contract that implements an internal helper function called _add for safe addition to prevent overflow. Additionally, the contract uses an internal transfer function _transfer, which utilizes the _add function to handle the token transfer while ensuring that the sender has sufficient balance.

By using internal helper functions, the ERC20Token contract can maintain clean and reusable code for arithmetic operations, reducing the risk of arithmetic overflows and underflows and improving the overall security and maintainability of the contract. These internal helper functions are not directly accessible or callable from outside the contract, but they play a critical role in the contract's internal operations and contribute to the overall functionality of the ERC20 token contract.

## Example: Internal Helper Function for SafeMath (Continued)

Building on the previous example, let's complete the ERC20Token contract with additional internal helper functions for ERC20 operations: _sub (safe subtraction) and _mul (safe multiplication).

```
solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ERC20Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) internal balances;

    function _add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        require(c >= a, "SafeMath: addition overflow");
        return c;
    }

    function _sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        require(b <= a, "SafeMath: subtraction underflow");
        uint256 c = a - b;
        return c;
    }

    function _mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (a == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        uint256 c = a * b;
        require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");
        return c;
    }

    // Internal transfer function using the safe arithmetic helper functions
    function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(sender != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(recipient != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

        // Check for sufficient balance
        require(amount <= balances[sender], "ERC20: insufficient balance");

        // Safe subtraction to deduct from sender
        balances[sender] = _sub(balances[sender], amount);
        balances[recipient] = _add(balances[recipient], amount);

        // Emit transfer event
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    }

    // Additional ERC20 functions and events...
}
```

In this updated example, we have added two more internal helper functions: _sub for safe subtraction and _mul for safe multiplication. These functions ensure that arithmetic operations do not result in underflows or overflows, protecting the contract from potential vulnerabilities.

The _transfer function has been updated to use the new _sub and _add functions for safe arithmetic operations during the token transfer process.

By implementing these internal helper functions, the ERC20Token contract is now equipped with robust and secure arithmetic operations for handling token transfers. The internal nature of these helper functions ensures that they are only used within the contract, reducing the risk of improper usage or external interference.

# Conclusion:
Using internal functions and internal helper functions is a best practice in Solidity smart contract development, particularly in ERC20 token contracts. Internal functions provide encapsulation of logic for internal contract operations, and internal helper functions offer reusable and secure arithmetic operations. These practices lead to more maintainable, secure, and efficient code, making smart contracts easier to understand and less prone to vulnerabilities.
